CDS_rule_311	Implications for protease inhibitor combinations with PEG-IFN alpha and RBV therapy: Approximately 60% chance for SVR after 24-48 weeks of treatment. Approximately 50% of patients are eligible for shortened therapy (24-28 weeks). Patients receiving telaprevir are eligible for 24 weeks of therapy instead of the standard 48 weeks if HCV RNA is undetectable by week four.
